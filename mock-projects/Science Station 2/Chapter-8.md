# Chapter 8: Nebula of Peril

The nebula was a chaotic swirl of colors and energy, a cosmic graveyard of shattered stars.  Navigating Stardust through the treacherous currents was a harrowing task, testing Eva Rostova's skills to the limit.

Within the nebula, they found it - a colossal structure of alien design, humming with immense power.  It was the ancient weapon, but it was guarded.

Strange, energy-based entities swarmed around the structure, protectors of the weapon.  Stardust was forced to fight its way through, lasers blazing, shields flickering, in a desperate race to reach the weapon before it was too late.
