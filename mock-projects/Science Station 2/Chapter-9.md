# Chapter 9: Activating the Weapon

The weapon's interface was alien, incomprehensible. But Dr. Thorne, guiding them remotely from Science Station 2, deciphered the activation sequence, drawing upon the last vestiges of Kryll knowledge.

With trembling fingers, Eva initiated the sequence. The ancient weapon roared to life, unleashing a beam of pure energy, aimed not at Oblivion, but at the heart of the nebula itself. A shockwave rippled outwards, disrupting the energy entities and clearing a path. The weapon was online, but its true power remained to be seen.
