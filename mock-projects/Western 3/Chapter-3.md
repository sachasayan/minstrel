# Chapter 3: Quick Draw

The tension in the saloon was thick enough to cut with a knife. Jed and Bart stared each other down, hands hovering over their guns. The only sound was the faint tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the corner.

Then, it happened. With lightning speed, Bart drew his gun. But Jed was faster. His Colt Peacemaker was out of its holster and firing in a blur of motion.

Two shots rang out, echoing through the saloon. Bart staggered back, a look of surprise on his face, his gun falling to the floor. He clutched at his chest, then slumped onto the table, his black hat rolling off to reveal a shock of greying hair.

The saloon erupted in noise. Some cheered, others gasped. Jed stood there, gun still smoking, his gaze fixed on the fallen outlaw. It was over. The reign of Black Bart Thompson was finished.
