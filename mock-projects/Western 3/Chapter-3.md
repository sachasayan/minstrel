# Chapter 3: Ambush at the Creek

The sun beat down on The Stranger as he rode towards the hills, following rumors of Coyote Jack's hideout. The air was dry, the landscape unforgiving. He knew this wouldn't be easy.

As he rounded a bend in a narrow creek bed, the silence shattered. Gunfire erupted from the rocks above, bullets whizzing past him. Coyote Jack's gang had been waiting.

The Stranger spurred his horse forward, seeking cover behind a cluster of boulders. He dismounted quickly, drawing his revolver. He returned fire, the shots echoing through the canyon.

"Well, well," a voice called out from above. "Looks like we got ourselves a visitor. You lost, friend?"

The Stranger recognized the voice. Coyote Jack.

"I'm here for you, Jack," The Stranger replied, his voice calm despite the chaos around him.

"You and what army?" Coyote Jack laughed. "You're outnumbered, stranger. Might as well give up now."

The Stranger didn't answer. He scanned the rocks, identifying the positions of the gang members. There were at least six of them, spread out along the ridge. He'd have to be smart to survive this.

He moved quickly, using the boulders as cover, picking off the gang members one by one. The fight was fierce, the air thick with gunpowder smoke. But The Stranger was relentless, his aim deadly accurate.

One by one, the gang members fell, until only Coyote Jack remained. He emerged from behind a rock, his face twisted with rage.

"You'll pay for this, stranger!" he roared, leveling his rifle.

The Stranger stood his ground, his eyes fixed on Coyote Jack. The showdown was about to begin.
