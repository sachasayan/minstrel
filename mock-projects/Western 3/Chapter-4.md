# Chapter 4: Justice Served

Sheriff Thompson, Bart's older brother, arrived, his face grim.  He surveyed the scene, his eyes lingering on his brother's lifeless body.  Then he turned to Jed, his expression unreadable.

"You killed him," the Sheriff stated, his voice flat.

"He drew first," Jed replied, holstering his gun.  "It was self-defense."

The Sheriff studied Jed for a long moment, then nodded slowly.  "Bart was a fool," he said, a hint of sadness in his voice.  "He brought this on himself."

He extended his hand to Jed.  "The town of Redemption thanks you, Mr. Stone.  You've done us a service."

Jed shook the Sheriff's hand, a sense of weary satisfaction washing over him.  Justice had been served, and the West was a little bit safer, thanks to the bounty hunter named Jedediah Stone.
