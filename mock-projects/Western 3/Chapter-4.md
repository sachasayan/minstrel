# Chapter 4: Sarah Helps The Stranger

The echoes of the gunfight faded as Coyote Jack lay motionless on the dusty ground. The Stranger holstered his revolver, assessing the scene. He was wounded, nothing life-threatening, but he needed to tend to it. As he began to gather his things, he heard footsteps approaching.

A woman emerged from behind a rocky outcrop, her face etched with concern. "Are you alright?" she asked, her voice soft but firm.

The Stranger nodded curtly. "I'll live."

"I'm Sarah," she said, extending a hand. "I saw what happened. That was quite a fight."

He hesitated for a moment before taking her hand. "Stranger."

Sarah led him back to her small, secluded cabin a short distance from the creek. It was simple but clean, a stark contrast to the rough and tumble world outside. She helped him clean his wounds, her touch gentle and efficient.

"You shouldn't stay out here," she said as she bandaged his arm. "Barlow's men will be looking for you. He and Coyote Jack were thick as thieves."

"Barlow?" The Stranger asked, his eyes narrowing.

"Sheriff Barlow," Sarah confirmed. "He runs this town, and he doesn't take kindly to strangers interfering with his business."

The Stranger leaned back in his chair, considering her words. "Then I guess I'll be leaving him with no choice."

Sarah smiled faintly. "I figured as much. That's why I'm going to help you."

She explained that she knew the back ways out of town, secret paths through the hills that Barlow's men would never think to look. She offered him food, water, and a place to rest.

"Why are you helping me?" The Stranger asked, suspicion coloring his tone.

Sarah's expression hardened. "Barlow's a cancer on this town. Someone needs to stand up to him. I can't do it alone, but maybe, just maybe, with your help..."

The Stranger looked at her, seeing the fire in her eyes, the determination etched on her face. He nodded slowly. "Alright, Sarah. I appreciate the help."

As the sun began to set, casting long shadows across the landscape, The Stranger and Sarah began to plan their next move. They knew that Sheriff Barlow would be coming for them, and they needed to be ready. The battle for Redemption was far from over.
