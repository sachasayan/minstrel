# Chapter 1: Arrival in Redemption

The sun beat down on the dusty plains as a lone rider approached the town of Redemption. The man, known only as The Stranger, squinted beneath the brim of his worn hat, his face weathered and unreadable. Redemption, a cluster of ramshackle buildings clinging precariously to the arid landscape, looked every bit as lawless as its reputation suggested.

He urged his horse forward, the animal's hooves kicking up small clouds of dust. The air was thick with the smell of stale beer, sweat, and desperation. As he rode down the main street, eyes followed him from behind the darkened windows of the saloon and the general store.

The Stranger paid them no mind. He was here for one reason, and one reason only: to find Coyote Jack.

He dismounted in front of the saloon, the "Golden Nugget," its name a faded promise of riches long gone. Tying his horse to the hitching post, he paused, his gaze sweeping across the street, taking in every detail.

The saloon doors creaked open as he stepped inside, the sudden darkness a momentary shock to his eyes. The interior was dimly lit, filled with the murmur of hushed conversations and the clinking of glasses. A piano player hammered out a mournful tune in the corner.

He walked to the bar, the floorboards groaning beneath his boots. The bartender, a burly man with a handlebar mustache, looked up with a wary expression.

"Whiskey," The Stranger said, his voice low and gravelly.

The bartender poured him a shot, his eyes never leaving The Stranger's face. "New in town, ain't ya?"

The Stranger took a slow sip of the whiskey. "Passing through."

"Heard that before," the bartender replied, wiping down the counter with a rag. "Most folks just pass on through. Redemption ain't got much to offer, 'less you're lookin' for trouble."

The Stranger finished his whiskey and set the glass down. "Maybe I am," he said, his eyes meeting the bartender's. "Looking for trouble."
