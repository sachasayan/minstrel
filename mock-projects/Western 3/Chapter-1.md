# Chapter 1: Dusty Trail

The sun beat down on Jed's weathered face as he rode his trusty steed, Dusty, across the barren plains.  The air shimmered with heat, and the only sound was the rhythmic creak of saddle leather and Dusty's steady hoofbeats.

Jed was a bounty hunter, and he was on the trail of the notorious outlaw, "Black Bart" Thompson.  Bart had robbed the First National Bank of Silver Gulch, and the reward for his capture was enough to set Jed up for life.

Days blurred into nights as Jed followed the faint tracks, his determination fueled by the promise of justice and a comfortable retirement.  He knew Bart was dangerous, but Jed was no stranger to danger.  He was a man of the West, hardened by the harsh land and driven by his own code.
