# Chapter 2: Whispers of Corruption

The bartender eyed The Stranger, a flicker of unease in his gaze. "Trouble's easy to find in Redemption. It's getting rid of it that's the problem. Especially when it wears a badge."

The Stranger raised an eyebrow. "Badge?"

"Sheriff Barlow runs this town," the bartender said, lowering his voice. "And he ain't afraid to bend the law, or break it, to get what he wants. Most folks just look the other way. It's safer that way."

"Safer for who?" The Stranger asked, his gaze unwavering.

The bartender hesitated. "Safer for everyone but Barlow's enemies. He's got a tight grip on Redemption. Controls the water, the land... everything. Anyone who crosses him ends up regretting it." He leaned closer. "I've seen good people disappear. Just... vanish."

The Stranger swirled the remaining whiskey in his glass. "And Coyote Jack?"

The bartender's eyes widened slightly. "You're looking for Coyote Jack? That's... ambitious. Barlow's been after him for months. Claims he's a menace. But some folks say Barlow just wants Jack's territory."

"Where would I find him?" The Stranger pressed.

The bartender glanced around nervously. "Don't know. And if I did, I wouldn't tell you. Not here. Not now." He straightened up, his voice regaining its usual gruffness. "Another whiskey?"

The Stranger shook his head. "Information. That's what I need." He tossed a silver dollar onto the counter. "For your trouble."

He turned and walked out of the saloon, back into the harsh sunlight. The bartender's words hung in the air, a warning and a challenge. Sheriff Barlow. Coyote Jack. The lines were blurring.

Outside, The Stranger scanned the street. A young boy, no older than ten, sat on a crate, watching him with wide, curious eyes. The Stranger approached him.

"You know this town?" The Stranger asked, his voice gentle.

The boy nodded, his gaze fixed on The Stranger's gun.

"Sheriff Barlow. What kind of man is he?"

The boy hesitated, then whispered, "He's... he's mean. He takes things. From people."

"And Coyote Jack?"

The boy's eyes darted around nervously. "He hides in the hills. With his gang."

The Stranger placed another coin in the boy's hand. "Thank you."

The boy scurried away, disappearing down a narrow alleyway. The Stranger watched him go, then turned and walked towards the sheriff's office, a grim determination in his eyes. He had a sheriff to meet.
