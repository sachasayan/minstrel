# Chapter 2: Saloon Showdown

Jed rode into the dusty town of Redemption, the midday sun casting long shadows.  He knew Black Bart was rumored to be hiding out here.  The town was quiet, almost too quiet, but Jed could feel the tension in the air.

He dismounted in front of the Last Chance Saloon, the swinging doors creaking in the slight breeze.  Inside, the saloon was dimly lit and filled with rough-looking characters.  A piano player tinkled a mournful tune in the corner.

Jed scanned the room, his eyes sharp and watchful.  Then he saw him, sitting at a back table, a black hat pulled low over his face.  Black Bart.

Jed approached the table, his hand hovering near the Colt Peacemaker holstered at his hip.  "Bart," he said, his voice low and steady.  "It's over."

Bart looked up, a sneer twisting his lips.  "Well, well, if it ain't Jedediah Stone," he drawled, his hand reaching for his own gun.  "Looks like you found me."

The saloon fell silent.  Everyone knew what was coming.  A showdown at the Last Chance Saloon.
