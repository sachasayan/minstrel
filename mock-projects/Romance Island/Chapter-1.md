# Chapter 1: First Meeting

The sun dipped below the horizon, painting the sky in hues of orange and pink. Isabelle sat at a small cafe table overlooking the beach, the gentle sound of waves providing a soothing backdrop. The salt air carried the scent of distant rain, a familiar and comforting aroma. She nervously tapped her fingers against the worn wooden tabletop, glancing at her watch for what felt like the tenth time in as many minutes. Her best friend, Chloe, had insisted on setting her up on this blind date, promising that Daniel was "perfect" for her. Isabelle wasn't so sure. Blind dates always felt so awkward, so forced. But Chloe's persistence, coupled with Isabelle's own dwindling hope of finding someone on her own, had led her here.

A figure approached, silhouetted against the fading light. He moved with a certain hesitancy, a slight hunch in his shoulders that telegraphed his own apprehension. As he drew closer, Isabelle could make out his features - kind eyes, a warm smile that seemed genuine, and a slightly nervous demeanor. He was taller than she expected, with tousled brown hair that caught the last rays of the setting sun. He wore a simple blue shirt and jeans, an outfit that suggested a relaxed and unpretentious personality.

"Isabelle?" he asked, his voice gentle and a little breathless. He seemed to be catching his breath, as if he'd rushed to get there.

"Yes," she replied, a smile mirroring his despite her earlier reservations. "You must be Daniel."

"Guilty as charged," he chuckled, running a hand through his hair. He pulled out the chair opposite her, his movements still a little awkward. "Sorry I'm a bit late. Traffic was a nightmare. I swear, every tourist in the city decided to head to the beach at the same time."

Isabelle laughed, a genuine laugh that eased some of her anxiety. "No worries. I haven't been waiting long." She gestured to the nearly empty glass of iced tea on the table. "Just enjoying the view."

Daniel took a seat, leaning back slightly in his chair. He gazed out at the ocean, his expression thoughtful. "It's beautiful, isn't it? I try to come here as often as I can. There's something about the ocean that just...calms me down."

"I agree," Isabelle said, her eyes following his. "It's my happy place."

And so began their story, under the romantic glow of the setting sun. The initial awkwardness melted away with each shared observation, each tentative question. As they talked, Isabelle found herself drawn to Daniel's easygoing nature and his genuine interest in her life. Maybe, just maybe, Chloe had been right after all.
