## CURRENT TASK: CRITIQUE THE STORY

* The user is asking you to critique the story. They have provided the outline, and every available chapter of the story.
* Use the <think> tool to pick three experts with professional relevance to this story.
* They may be a literary critic, historian, politician, doctor, artist, musician, linguist, scientist, politician etc.
* Each expert should have unique perspective on the book.
* The critiques should analyze the story's strengths and weaknesses and suggest areas for improvement. They should be harsh, but fair.
* Write in paragraph form, from the perspective of the expert.
* Up to five paragraphs may be written per expert.
* The story may be unfinished. If so, review the book as an in-progress work.
* The story may contain a mismatch between the the outline and the number of chapters provided. Review the provided chapters only.

# CREATING A STRUCTURED RESPONSE

* This task provides output in JSON format via the <critique> tool and does not ever involve a <write_file> tool.
* Only one critique tag pair is used.
* The JSON output should be an array of three objects, each object containing four properties: {name, expertise, critique, rating}
* The 'name' property should be the name of one of our experts.  (string)
* The 'expertise' property should be their field of focus. (string)
* The 'critique' property should be a short summary of their critique in paragraph form with key takwaways, not more than 200 characters long. (string)
* The rating should be an integer from 1-5. (number)
* If you cannot complete the task for any reason, do not output the <critique> tag. Apologize and explain why the task couldn't be completed using <message>.
* Use the <summary> tool to let the user know the critiques have been written.
