# Current Task: Implement Multi-Agent Workflow

## Status

We have implemented a multi-agent workflow in `chatManager.ts` and `promptBuilder.ts`. The system now uses a routing agent to delegate tasks to specialized agents (criticAgent, outlineAgent, writerAgent).

## Completed Steps

The codebase has been refactored to implement a multi-agent workflow.

Key changes include:

*   **`chatManager.ts`**:  Modified to handle routing of requests to different agents based on the model's response (`<route_to>` tag).
*   **`promptBuilder.ts`**: Updated to build prompts specific to each agent type (routingAgent, criticAgent, outlineAgent, writerAgent).
*   **Agent Prompts**: New prompt templates have been created for each agent type in `prompts.ts` (though not provided in this update).

The system now uses a `routingAgent` as the default agent, which then determines the appropriate specialized agent to handle the user's request.

## Next Steps

1.  **Review Agent Prompts**: We need to examine and refine the prompts for each agent type to ensure they are effective and aligned with their specific roles.
2.  **Testing and Refinement**:  Thoroughly test the multi-agent workflow with various user requests and scenarios.
3.  **Implement specialized agent logic**: Currently the specialized agents use the same prompt templates, we need to customize these prompts to take advantage of the multi-agent architecture.
