# Minstrel Active Context

## Current Work Focus

The current focus is on UI/UX improvements and investigating Tailwind CSS v4 theming. Recent efforts have concentrated on:

*   Ensuring the "Add Chapter" functionality correctly dispatches a user message to the model.
*   Improving error handling, particularly around file saving and directory creation.
*   Making the sidebar collapsible and adding dynamic chapter icons.
*   Updating project documentation (`projectContext.md`) to reflect the current state of the implementation.
* Cleaning up CSS and reviewing Tailwind configuration.

## Recent Changes

*   Fixed a bug where new projects were not saving due to missing directory creation logic.
*   Implemented error handling to catch and report failures in file system operations (directory creation and file writing).
*   Added a `ChapterIcon` component to `AppSidebar.tsx` to display chapter numbers dynamically.
*   Modified the "Add Chapter" button to dispatch an `addChatMessage` action.
*   Made the sidebar collapsible.
*   Added icons to the sidebar navigation buttons.
*   Updated `chatManager.ts` to correctly reset the `pendingChat` state after successful API calls, preventing the UI from getting stuck in a loading state.
