## Current Work Focus

The current focus is on UI/UX improvements and investigating Tailwind CSS v4 theming. Recent efforts have concentrated on:

*   Ensuring the "Add Chapter" functionality correctly dispatches a user message to the model.
*   Improving error handling, particularly around file saving and directory creation.
*   Making the sidebar collapsible and adding dynamic chapter icons.
