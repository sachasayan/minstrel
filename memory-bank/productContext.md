# Minstrel Product Context

## Why This Project Exists

This project, Minstrel, aims to create a collaborative writing experience between a user and an AI model, specifically for novel writing. It addresses the challenges many writers face, such as writer's block, difficulty structuring a long-form narrative, and maintaining consistency throughout a complex story.

## Problems It Solves

- **Writer's Block:** The AI model assists in generating ideas, overcoming creative hurdles, and providing fresh perspectives.
- **Structure and Planning:** The system guides the user through a structured process of skeleton creation, outlining, and chapter writing, making the daunting task of writing a novel more manageable.
- **Consistency:** By providing context and tracking story elements, the AI helps maintain consistency in characters, plot points, and overall narrative.
- **Co-creation:** It fosters a collaborative environment where the user and AI work together, combining human creativity with AI's ability to generate and process large amounts of text.
- **Accessibility:** It provides a guided approach to novel-writing, making it more accessible to novice writers.

## How It Should Work (User Experience Goals)

The user should feel like they are collaborating with a knowledgeable and helpful writing partner. The interaction should be intuitive and seamless, with the AI providing assistance without being overly intrusive.

1.  **Intuitive Interface:** The chat interface should be clean, easy to use, and provide clear feedback on the AI's actions.
2.  **Guided Workflow:** The system should guide the user through the stages of novel writing (skeleton, outline, chapters, critique) in a logical and understandable way.
3.  **Customization:** The user should be able to customize the story parameters and edit the AI-generated content at each stage.
4.  **Transparency:** The AI should explain its reasoning (through the `<think>` tag, though this is hidden from the user) and clearly communicate its actions (through the `<message>` tag).
5.  **Responsiveness:** The system should respond promptly to user input and provide timely feedback.
6.  **Iteration:** The user should be able to easily iterate on any part of the novel, requesting rewrites or adjustments as needed.

The overall experience should be one of empowerment, where the AI assists the user in realizing their creative vision, rather than dictating the story.
